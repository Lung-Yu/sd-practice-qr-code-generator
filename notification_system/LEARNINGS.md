# Notification System — Load Test Learnings

## Tier 1 + Tier 2A Baseline (k6, 4-worker, FAILURE_RATE=0, Redis store)

### What the test showed

| Metric | Result | Target | Pass? |
|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| POST /send p95 | 544 ms | < 500 ms | ❌ |
| POST /send p99 | 738 ms | < 1000 ms | ✓ |
| GET /{id} p95 | 462 ms | < 500 ms | ✓ |
| GET list p95 | 466 ms | < 500 ms | ✓ |
| Error rate | 0.00% | < 1% | ✓ |
| 404s (cross-worker) | 0 | — | ✓ (Redis fixed this) |
| Actual throughput | ~1750 RPS | 5000 RPS | ❌ |
| Dropped iterations | 196,653 | 0 | ❌ |

### Why we only hit ~1750 RPS instead of 5000

**Little's Law**: required VUs = RPS × avg_latency_s

- At 244 ms avg latency → need 5000 × 0.244 = **1220 VUs** to sustain 5000 RPS
- k6 cap is 600 VUs → actual max = 600 / 0.244 ≈ **2459 RPS** theoretical
- We only got 1750 RPS because latency climbs under load (queueing)

The root cause: **POST /send is still synchronous end-to-end.** Each request pays:
1. Redis HSET/SET/ZADD pipeline (save as PENDING) — ~2 ms
2. `channel.send()` in thread pool — ~0.1 ms (no failure simulation)
3. Redis HSET/SET/ZADD pipeline again (save as SENT) — ~2 ms
4. Uvicorn/HTTP overhead

Even with zero simulated failures, 2 Redis round trips per request (both in the HTTP path) cap latency. Under high concurrency, queueing inflates this to 200+ ms median.

### What Redis fixed (vs old in-memory store)

- **Zero 404s** on GET /{id} — previously ~10–20% of cross-worker GETs returned 404 because workers had separate in-memory stores. Redis gives all 4 workers a shared view.
- **Global idempotency** — duplicate POSTs now dedup across all workers, not just within one process.
- **Durability** — restart no longer loses notifications (Redis AOF enabled).

### What's still broken

- **POST /send p95 > 500 ms** — fails the SLO because delivery is synchronous in the request path.
- **5000 RPS target not reachable** — fundamentally blocked until delivery is moved out of the HTTP path.

## Tier 2B: BackgroundTasks — What Happened and Why

**Pattern applied:** POST /send saves as PENDING → returns 202 → `deliver()` runs after response via `BackgroundTasks`.

### Tier 2B k6 results (same 4-worker, 5000 RPS target)

| Metric | Before (2A) | After (2B) | Δ |
|--------|-------------|------------|---|
| POST /send p95 | 544 ms | 579 ms | ❌ worse |
| GET /{id} p95 | 462 ms | 516 ms | ❌ worse |
| List p95 | 466 ms | 519 ms | ❌ worse |
| Throughput | ~1750 RPS | ~1767 RPS | same |
| Dropped iterations | 196,653 | 197,086 | same |

### Why BackgroundTasks made things WORSE

This is a classic FAANG trap. **BackgroundTasks uses the same thread pool as request handlers.**

FastAPI runs sync route handlers via `anyio.to_thread.run_sync` (a shared thread pool, default ~40 threads per worker process). BackgroundTasks for sync functions also use this thread pool — they just run *after* the response is written, but the thread is still occupied.

Under overload (1750 RPS, 600 VU cap, system already saturated):
- Each POST /send creates a background delivery task
- That task uses a thread from the same pool that's also serving new incoming requests
- Net effect: MORE contention on the same thread pool → all endpoints queue longer → p95 rises across the board

The key insight: **moving work to BackgroundTasks only helps if the system has spare thread capacity.** At 5000 RPS target (well above our ~2500 RPS ceiling), there is no spare capacity. You're just rearranging debt.

### What actually needs to happen

| Approach | Description | Result |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| FastAPI BackgroundTasks | Same process, same thread pool | ❌ Doesn't help under saturation |
| `asyncio.create_task` | Same process, async (no thread needed) | ✓ If channels are async |
| Separate delivery container | Different process, different CPU | ✓ True isolation |
| Redis Streams + worker | Queue decouples producers from consumers | ✓ Production pattern |

The correct Tier 2B is a **dedicated delivery worker container** reading from a Redis Stream — the HTTP workers only enqueue (`XADD`), the delivery workers only dequeue and call channel.send(). These never share a thread pool.

BackgroundTasks is the right *pattern* but wrong *implementation* when the service is already at thread pool saturation. At lower load (e.g., 2000 RPS on this hardware), BackgroundTasks would show clear improvement.

## NFR Improvement Scorecard

## Tier 2C: Separate Delivery Worker Container (Redis Streams)

**Architecture change:**
- HTTP workers: POST /send → save PENDING → `XADD notifications:delivery {notification_id}` → return 202 immediately
- Delivery worker (`delivery-worker` container): `XREADGROUP` → `store.get(id)` → `deliver()` → `XACK`
- Consumer group `delivery-workers`: Redis ensures each message is consumed by exactly one worker
- Worker uses `socket.gethostname()` as consumer name → unique per container

### Tier 2C k6 results

| Metric | 2A (Redis store) | 2B (BackgroundTasks) | 2C (Stream worker) |
|--------|-----------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| POST /send p95 | 544 ms ❌ | 579 ms ❌ | **466 ms ✓** |
| GET /{id} p95 | 462 ms ✓ | 516 ms ❌ | **450 ms ✓** |
| List p95 | 466 ms ✓ | 519 ms ❌ | **455 ms ✓** |
| Error rate | 0.00% ✓ | 0.00% ✓ | **0.00% ✓** |
| Throughput | ~1750 RPS | ~1767 RPS | **~2070 RPS** |
| All thresholds | ❌ 2 fail | ❌ 4 fail | **✓ ALL PASS** |

### Why it worked: true process isolation

The delivery worker is a **separate container** — isolated CPU, memory, and thread pool. HTTP path is now just:
```
POST /send → validate → idempotency check → Redis HSET (PENDING) → Redis XADD → return 202
```
Two cheap Redis ops, then done. `deliver()` never touches the HTTP thread pool.

## Tier 3: Circuit Breaker, DLQ, Rate Limiting

### Circuit Breaker (`app/circuit_breaker.py` + `channels/registry.py`)

Hand-rolled state machine — no external dependency needed (~60 lines):

```
CLOSED → (N consecutive failures) → OPEN → (after recovery_seconds) → HALF_OPEN
HALF_OPEN → (success) → CLOSED
HALF_OPEN → (failure) → OPEN
```

Key insight: breakers live at **module level** in `registry.py` (`_BREAKERS` dict), not per-request. Each `get_channel()` call returns a `_ProtectedChannel` wrapping the same stateful breaker. This means state persists across all requests in a worker process.

Without the CB, a channel degraded to 90% failure rate makes every delivery attempt wait for `MAX_RETRIES × ATTEMPT_TIMEOUT_S = 15s` before giving up. With CB, after 5 consecutive failures the circuit trips OPEN: all subsequent calls fail-fast in microseconds instead of seconds, protecting worker thread capacity.

Metric: `circuit_breaker_trips_total{channel}` — alert when rate > 0.

### Dead-Letter Queue (`app/queue.py` + `app/delivery.py`)

When `deliver()` exhausts all retries, it pushes the notification_id to `notifications:dlq` (Redis List). Admin endpoints:
- `GET /admin/dlq` → depth + sample peek (non-destructive LRANGE)
- `POST /admin/dlq/retry?count=N` → pops N from DLQ, XADDs back to delivery stream

This gives ops a requeue button without re-architecting the delivery path.

### Per-User Rate Limiting (`app/routes.py`)

Fixed-window counter in Redis:
- Key: `ratelimit:{user_id}:{epoch // window_s}`
- INCR + conditional EXPIRE (2 round-trips, no Lua)
- Default: 100 requests / 60 seconds per user
- Returns 429 on breach; increments `rate_limit_hits_total` prometheus counter

Verified: 110 rapid requests from one user → 10 rejections (exactly over the 100 limit).

Metric: `rate_limit_hits_total` — alert on sustained 429 rate (signal of abuse or misconfigured client).

---

## Tier 3A: Nginx Load Balancer + Horizontal Scaling

### Architecture

```
k6 (8080) → nginx → notification-api-1..4 (each: 4 uvicorn workers)
                         ↓
                     Redis (shared state)
                         ↑
              delivery-worker (1 container, Redis Stream consumer)
```

nginx config: `keepalive 64` (reuse TCP connections to backends), `proxy_http_version 1.1`, round-robin.

### Benchmark comparison

| Config | Workers | Throughput | POST p95 | GET p95 | All pass? |
|--------|---------|------------|----------|---------|-----------|
| 1 container, 1 worker/container (broken) | 1 | ~1473 RPS | 1.48s ❌ | 1.43s ❌ | No |
| 1 container, 4 workers | 4 | ~2070 RPS | **466ms ✓** | 450ms ✓ | **Yes** |
| 4 containers, 4 workers each + nginx | 16 | ~2362 RPS | 590ms ❌ | **332ms ✓** | No |

### Key insight: READ vs WRITE scaling asymmetry

**GET /{id}** scales linearly with more replicas (−26%: 450ms→332ms). Each replica fetches from Redis independently; more replicas = more parallel reads.

**POST /send** gets WORSE under nginx at high concurrency (+27%: 466ms→590ms) because:
1. nginx adds a connection hop (~1-2ms + queuing under peak load)
2. At 5000 RPS target, all 600 VUs × connection pooling overhead compounds in the nginx→backend path
3. Round-robin can't perfectly balance write pressure; a momentarily slow backend stalls its keepalive connections

### The fix for POST at nginx scale

- **`least_conn` upstream**: route to the backend with fewest active connections — avoids head-of-line blocking from a slow replica
- **Async Python routes** (`async def` + `redis.asyncio`): eliminates thread pool entirely; POST returns in ~0.5ms (just 2 async Redis calls)
- **gRPC internal**: skip nginx for internal paths; use nginx only for the public edge

### Why nginx is still worth adding

Even though POST p95 failed the 500ms threshold, nginx delivered:
- Stable external endpoint regardless of how many backends are running
- Zero-downtime rolling restarts (nginx re-routes while a container restarts)
- `keepalive` reduces TCP handshake overhead by 60–80% vs plain reverse proxy
- Health check endpoint (`/nginx-health`) for load balancer probes
- Separation of concerns: TLS termination, rate limiting, request logging all move to nginx

The right takeaway: nginx LB works well for READ-heavy workloads at these concurrency levels. For write-heavy or latency-critical paths, async code + connection pooling is the next lever.

---

## Tier 3B: Async Routes + Redis Readiness

### Changes
- All route handlers converted to `async def` with `redis.asyncio` client (pool size 100)
- FastAPI startup event waits for Redis readiness (handles `BusyLoadingError` on AOF replay)
- `least_conn` added to nginx scale config (avoids round-robin head-of-line blocking)

### Results: single container, 4 workers, direct port 8000

| Metric | 2C Sync | 3B Async | Change |
|--------|---------|---------|--------|
| POST /send p95 | 466ms ✓ | **283ms ✓** | −39% |
| GET /{id} p95 | 450ms ✓ | **137ms ✓** | −69% |
| List p95 | 455ms ✓ | **176ms ✓** | −61% |
| Throughput | ~2070 RPS | **~3072 RPS** | +48% |
| Error rate | 0.00% ✓ | 0.17% ✓ | — |

Async routes remove the thread pool entirely for IO-bound paths. Each coroutine just suspends at the `await`, freeing the event loop to serve other requests — no thread context-switching overhead.

### Results: 4 containers × 4 workers + nginx + least_conn

| Metric | 3A (sync, round-robin) | 3B (async, least_conn) |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|
| POST p95 | 590ms ❌ | 596ms ❌ |
| GET p95 | 332ms ✓ | **234ms ✓** |
| Error rate | 0.00% ✓ | **0.00% ✓** |
| Throughput | ~2362 RPS | ~2060 RPS |

### Key insight: async routes help single-container far more than multi-container

Single container + async: **3072 RPS** (best result yet). Nginx-scale + async: **2060 RPS** (FEWER than single container).

Why adding 4× compute with nginx gives FEWER RPS:
1. nginx hop adds ~50–100ms latency to every request under high concurrency
2. More containers = more Redis connection pools (20 uvicorn processes × 100+100 async connections = 4,000 potential connections); Redis connection management overhead grows
3. Little's Law: the nginx latency increase raises VUs-needed above the 600-VU cap more than additional parallelism lowers average latency

**The IO-bound scaling wall**: when the bottleneck is network round-trips to Redis (not CPU), adding more processes doesn't help. All 16 workers are waiting on the same Redis. More waiters = more queueing on the Redis connection pool, not more throughput.

### BusyLoadingError root cause + fix

Redis replays its AOF log on every restart. If API workers start before AOF replay completes, all Redis commands return `LOADING` → 500 errors. k6 `setup()` ran during this window → `seedIds = []` → all GET checks used fallback UUID → 500 (still loading) → 0% GET check success.

Fix: `@app.on_event("startup")` blocks worker initialization until `redis.ping()` succeeds. Delivery worker already had this; now HTTP API workers do too.

### What would actually fix POST p95 under nginx scale

- **Redis cluster**: shard write load across multiple Redis nodes — eliminates single-Redis bottleneck
- **Skip nginx for writes**: use DNS-based client-side load balancing (gRPC + service discovery) — removes nginx hop from the hot path  
- **Vertical scale**: 1 large container + more uvicorn workers outperforms N small containers + nginx for IO-bound workloads at these RPS levels

---

## Tier 4: Async Delivery Worker

**Change:** `worker.py` converted from synchronous blocking loop to `asyncio.gather()` concurrent batch processing. BATCH_SIZE lifted from 10 → 20.

```
# Before: sequential
for msg_id, data in msgs:
    notification = store.get(nid)
    deliver(notification)
    r.xack(...)

# After: concurrent
tasks = [_process_message(r, msg_id, data, loop) for msg_id, data in msgs]
await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
```

Each task: `await store.aget(nid)` → `await loop.run_in_executor(None, deliver, notification)` → `await r.xack(...)`. The executor is needed because `channel.send()` is sync (simulates network latency with sleep).

**Key insight:** batch total time = `max(delivery_time)` instead of `sum(delivery_time)`. Under high failure rate with retries, this is N× faster per batch.

**Bug fixed:** `redis.asyncio` module has no `.exceptions` attribute — must use top-level `redis.exceptions` for `BusyLoadingError`, `ConnectionError`, `ResponseError`.

| Metric | 3B (sync worker) | 4 (async worker) | Δ |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|---|
| POST p95 | 283ms ✓ | 361ms ✓ | +28% |
| GET p95 | 137ms ✓ | 172ms ✓ | +25% |
| Throughput | ~3072 RPS | ~2736 RPS | −11% |
| All pass | ✓ | ✓ | — |

API-side regression: async worker creates 20 concurrent thread-pool tasks per batch, adding Redis write pressure from the worker side. The win is delivery throughput (drains backlogs faster), not API RPS.

---

## Tier 5: Failure Mode Testing (FAILURE_RATE=0.2)

### Connection Pool Exhaustion (first attempt — catastrophic failure)

Running with `max_connections=100` and 600 VUs caused **83% error rate** from `redis.exceptions.ConnectionError: Too many connections` — this is client-side pool exhaustion, NOT a Redis server problem. The two look identical in logs.

**Root cause:** with 600 VUs and async routes, up to 600 coroutines may simultaneously hold an open connection during `await pipeline.execute()`. Pool of 100 < 600 concurrent holders → exception raised immediately (redis-py does NOT block-and-wait by default).

**Fix:** `max_connections=1000` in both `store_redis.py` and `queue.py`.

**Formula:** `required_pool ≥ peak_concurrent_VUs × max_simultaneous_redis_ops_per_request`

### Results (FAILURE_RATE=0.2, pool=1000, 4 uvicorn workers)

All thresholds pass. API is 100% reliable despite 20% channel failure rate — circuit breaker and DLQ are invisible to HTTP clients.

| Metric | Result | Target |
|--------|--------|--------|
| POST p95 | 358ms | <500ms ✓ |
| GET p95 | 169ms | <500ms ✓ |
| Error rate | 0.00% | <1% ✓ |
| All checks | 621,538/621,538 | 100% ✓ |

**Reliability machinery active:**
- Circuit breaker trips: email=3567, sms=2831, push=1633 — CB oscillates OPEN→HALF_OPEN→CLOSED as channel failures are intermittent
- DLQ accumulated: 22,104 entries — CB OPEN fast-fail → DLQ (bypasses all 3 retries), so DLQ >> theoretical 0.8% permanent failure rate
- Total retries: ~7,052 across channels

### DLQ Retry Verification

After restoring FAILURE_RATE=0 (simulating channel recovery), replayed the entire DLQ:

```bash
POST /admin/dlq/retry?count=5000  # × 4 batches + 1 final batch
# DLQ: 22,104 → 11,904 → 6,904 → 1,904 → 0
```

All 22,104 previously FAILED notifications delivered successfully. Status updated to `sent`; `sent_at` timestamp reflects the retry time.

**Design quirk discovered:** `error` field is NOT cleared on successful retry — it preserves the previous circuit breaker message even after status becomes `sent`. Fix: clear `notification.error = None` in the success branch of `deliver()`.

**DLQ drain rate:** ~733/second at FAILURE_RATE=0 (no retries needed, fast delivery).

**Production ops playbook:**
1. DLQ depth alert fires (threshold: > 1000)
2. Diagnose channel health (circuit breaker state, external provider status)
3. Wait for channel recovery (or fix underlying issue)
4. Replay: `POST /admin/dlq/retry?count=N` in batches
5. Monitor: `notifications_sent_total{status="SENT"}` rises, DLQ depth falls to 0

---

## Tier 6: Multi-Worker Delivery Scaling (4 × delivery-worker)

### Setup

Scaled delivery-worker to 4 container instances sharing the `delivery-workers` consumer group:

```bash
FAILURE_RATE=0 MAX_RETRIES=1 podman-compose -f docker-compose.yml \
  -f k6s/docker-compose.loadtest.yml up -d --scale delivery-worker=4
```

**Port conflict fixed first:** removed `ports: ["8001:8001"]` from `docker-compose.yml` — static host port binding prevents scaling. Prometheus reaches workers via `sd_monitoring` network DNS (round-robins across instances).

### Consumer Group Distribution

Each worker uses `socket.gethostname()` as consumer name → unique container ID per instance. Redis XREADGROUP `>` ensures exactly-once delivery across all consumers.

| Worker | Container ID | Messages delivered |
|--------|--------------|--------------------|
| 1 | a2a57a26da65 | 16,423 |
| 2 | 8a68aa5d4ea7 | 16,701 |
| 3 | d7c848441057 | 16,652 |
| 4 | feb87a153fb3 | 16,769 |
| **Total** | | **66,545** |

Distribution: ~25% per worker. No duplicates (consumer group guarantees exactly-once claim per message).

### Latency Regression

| Config | POST p95 | GET p95 | Throughput | All pass? |
|--------|----------|---------|------------|-----------|
| 1 delivery worker (Tier 4) | 361ms ✓ | 172ms ✓ | 2,736 RPS | ✓ |
| 4 delivery workers (Tier 6) | **1,450ms ❌** | **532ms ❌** | **800 RPS** | ❌ |

Error rate stayed 0.00% — no connection errors, pure latency degradation.

### Root Cause: Redis Single-Threaded Command Queue Saturation

Each delivery worker runs `asyncio.gather()` at BATCH_SIZE=20:
- `store.aget(nid)` → Redis HGETALL per message
- `loop.run_in_executor(None, deliver, notification)` → sync `store.save()`: pipeline(HSET + SET + ZADD) per message
- `r.xack()` → XACK per message

4 workers × 20 concurrent delivers = **80 simultaneous Redis pipelines** from workers alone.

Plus API: 600 VUs × 4 async Redis ops each = hundreds of concurrent API commands.

Redis is single-threaded. With 80+ delivery pipelines queued, every Redis command waits proportionally longer. This cascades directly to API latency — each POST /send makes 4 Redis calls, so if each call waits 10× longer, p95 jumps ~4× longer.

**IO-bound scaling wall — advanced edition:** adding more delivery workers adds more Redis contention, not more compute. The bottleneck is the serialization point (Redis), not the workers themselves.

### BATCH_SIZE inverse scaling rule

With a single Redis, the total concurrent delivery pipeline count is the lever:
```
total_concurrent_deliveries = num_workers × BATCH_SIZE
```

To preserve the same Redis command rate when scaling workers:
- 1 worker, BATCH_SIZE=20 → 20 concurrent
- 4 workers, BATCH_SIZE=5  → 20 concurrent (same Redis pressure, 4× delivery containers)

### What would actually fix multi-worker scaling

| Approach | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Separate delivery Redis | API uses Redis-A (state); worker uses Redis-B (stream + delivery writes) — independent workloads, no cross-contention |
| Redis Cluster | Shard delivery writes to different nodes from API reads |
| Reduce BATCH_SIZE inversely | `BATCH_SIZE = target_concurrency / num_workers` — simple config fix, same Redis load |
| Dedicated delivery store | Worker writes to a separate fast store (e.g., Cassandra) for delivery status; API reads from primary Redis |

The right production pattern: **two Redis instances** — API-facing Redis for idempotency, rate limiting, and notification state reads; delivery Redis for the Stream, ACK, and delivery status writes.

### What This Test Validated

Despite the latency failure, Tier 6 confirmed:
1. **Exactly-once delivery across N workers** — Redis consumer group works correctly at scale
2. **Consumer name = hostname = unique per container** — no coordination needed for unique consumer IDs in docker-compose/Kubernetes
3. **Even load distribution** — ~25% per worker with zero configuration (Redis natural distribution)
4. **Bottleneck is Redis, not workers** — workers are idle-capable; the serialization point is the single Redis instance

---

## Tier 6a: BATCH_SIZE Inverse Scaling Fix

**Hypothesis:** if Tier 6 failed because 4 workers × BATCH_SIZE=20 = 80 concurrent Redis pipelines saturated Redis, then 4 workers × BATCH_SIZE=5 = 20 concurrent (same as Tier 4 baseline) should restore performance.

**Change:** `WORKER_BATCH_SIZE` env var added to `config.py` and `docker-compose.yml` delivery-worker environment block.

### Results

| Config | POST p95 | GET p95 | Throughput | All pass? |
|--------|----------|---------|------------|-----------|
| Tier 4: 1 worker, BS=20 | 361ms ✓ | 172ms ✓ | 2,736 RPS | ✓ |
| Tier 6: 4 workers, BS=20 | 1,450ms ❌ | 532ms ❌ | 800 RPS | ❌ |
| **Tier 6a: 4 workers, BS=5** | **351ms ✓** | **162ms ✓** | **2,838 RPS** | **✓** |

Consumer distribution (per-worker SENT counts): 57,739 / 58,150 / 57,988 / 57,971 — ~25% each, 231,848 total.

### What this proves

The `num_workers × BATCH_SIZE = constant` rule works: keeping total concurrent Redis pipelines constant (20) restores API latency regardless of how many worker containers share the load.

### What this does NOT solve

BATCH_SIZE tuning is a config fix, not a scaling fix. 4 workers × BS=5 delivers the same 20 concurrent notifications as 1 worker × BS=20. The real throughput benefit of multiple workers is **fault tolerance** (1 worker failure = 25% delivery capacity lost, not 100%), not raw speed.

To get 4× delivery throughput without API latency regression, the fix is Tier 7: separate Redis instances for API state vs delivery stream.

---

## Tier 7: Split Delivery Redis (Stream + DLQ Isolation)

**Change:** Added `redis-delivery` service to `docker-compose.yml`. Stream operations (XADD, XREADGROUP, XACK) and DLQ use `DELIVERY_REDIS_URL`; notification state (HASH, idempotency, rate limits, user ZSETs) stays on primary `REDIS_URL`. Falls back to `REDIS_URL` when `DELIVERY_REDIS_URL` is unset — backward-compatible single-Redis mode preserved.

Files: `config.py` (new `DELIVERY_REDIS_URL`), `queue.py` (use delivery URL for all clients), `worker.py` (XREADGROUP client uses delivery URL).

### Results: 4 workers × BATCH_SIZE=20, separate delivery Redis

| Config | POST p95 | GET p95 | RPS | Pass? |
|--------|----------|---------|-----|-------|
| Tier 6: 4w BS=20, 1 Redis | 1,450ms ❌ | 532ms ❌ | 800 | ❌ |
| Tier 6a: 4w BS=5, 1 Redis | 351ms ✓ | 162ms ✓ | 2,838 | ✓ |
| **Tier 7: 4w BS=20, 2 Redis** | **623ms ❌** | **281ms ✓** | **1,963** | ❌ |

Consumer distribution: 40,119 / 39,951 / 40,211 / 40,093 SENT per worker (~25% each).

### Why Tier 7 only partially improved latency

Stream isolation removed XADD/XREADGROUP/XACK from primary Redis ✓. But `deliver()` in each worker still calls `store.save()` (HSET + SET + ZADD pipeline) on the **primary Redis** after every delivery. With 4 workers × BATCH_SIZE=20, that's 80 concurrent delivery-status pipelines still competing with API requests on primary Redis.

GET p95 improved (281ms vs 532ms) because stream operations no longer compete with reads. POST p95 still fails (623ms) because delivery status writes still do.

### Root cause diagram

```
Primary Redis pressure sources:
  API: INCR+EXPIRE (rate limit) + GET (idempotency) + pipeline(HSET+SET+ZADD) + XADD*
  Worker: HGETALL (store.aget × 80) + pipeline(HSET+SET+ZADD) (store.save × 80)
                                                                ^--- still here in Tier 7
  (* XADD now goes to delivery Redis ✓)
```

### What would fully isolate

To eliminate worker→primary-Redis pressure, delivery workers would need to write status updates to a separate store:
- **Separate delivery-status Redis (Redis-C)**: workers write SENT/FAILED to Redis-C; API reads from both Redis-A (notifications) and Redis-C (delivery status)
- **Event bus**: delivery outcomes published as events, API state updated asynchronously

Both add operational complexity. For current scale, **Tier 6a (BATCH_SIZE inverse scaling)** achieves the same result without extra infrastructure.

### Key takeaways

- Stream isolation is necessary but not sufficient when workers write back to the primary store
- Tier 6a's `num_workers × BATCH_SIZE = constant` rule is simpler and more effective at this scale
- Multi-Redis split pays off when delivery status write volume exceeds what a single Redis can handle (much higher RPS than current setup)
- Backward-compatible via env var fallback — zero config change for existing single-Redis deployments

## Tier 7+: Batch Read (abatch_get) + Batch XACK

**Change:** Replaced per-message `_process_message()` coroutines with a single `_process_batch()` that pipelines all HGETALL reads and collapses all XACKs into one command per batch.

### Two optimizations

**`abatch_get()`** in `store_redis.py`:
```python
async def abatch_get(self, notification_ids: list[str]) -> list[Optional[Notification]]:
    pipe = self._ar.pipeline()
    for nid in notification_ids:
        pipe.hgetall(f"notification:{nid}")
    results = await pipe.execute()
    return [_deserialize(d) if d else None for d in results]
```
N individual HGETALL round-trips → 1 pipeline round-trip. Saves (N−1) × RTT per batch.

**Batch XACK** in `worker.py`:
```python
await r.xack(STREAM_KEY, GROUP_NAME, *msg_ids)
```
N individual XACK commands → 1 command. `XACK` natively accepts multiple IDs.

### Results with clean Redis

| Config | POST p95 | GET p95 | LIST p95 | Pass? |
|--------|----------|---------|----------|-------|
| Tier 7+save_status (4M keys) | 759ms ❌ | 287ms ✓ | 426ms ✓ | ❌ |
| **Tier 7+abatch_get (clean Redis)** | **408–430ms ✓** | **143–153ms ✓** | **210–224ms ✓** | **✓** |

All thresholds pass for the first time with 4-worker × BS=5 configuration.

### Redis keyspace size is a hidden variable

Primary Redis accumulated 4M keys across multiple test runs, causing a 2× latency increase (408ms → 759ms). Redis stores everything in RAM, but a larger keyspace means:
- More memory pressure → possible container OOM/swap
- Longer AOF replay at startup → extended `LOADING` error window
- Slower key lookup in large hash tables (marginal but measurable at 4M keys)

**Production fix**: set TTL on notification HASHes; configure `maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru`.

### Startup race condition: PING ≠ ready

`_wait_for_redis` uses `PING` to detect Redis readiness. Redis 7 responds to `PING` during AOF replay but returns `LOADING` for all data commands. When only delivery Redis was waited on, `abatch_get()` (hitting primary Redis) caused a tight error loop at startup — workers read batches from the stream but couldn't fetch notifications, never ACKed them, and accumulated thousands of pending messages.

**Fix**: wait for both delivery Redis and primary Redis before entering the main loop.

### abatch_get design tradeoff

Old per-message approach allowed reads and deliveries to overlap (message 1's delivery starts as soon as its HGETALL completes, while messages 2–5 are still being fetched). New batch approach: all reads must complete before any delivery starts. For BS=5 with ~1ms Redis RTT, the overlap benefit is negligible and the saved round-trips outweigh it. For larger BS or higher-latency Redis, the gap grows.

### Final benchmark progression

| Tier | Config | POST p95 | Pass? |
|------|--------|----------|-------|
| T4 | 1w × BS=20, 1 Redis | 361ms | ✓ |
| T6 | 4w × BS=20, 1 Redis | 1,450ms | ❌ |
| T6a | 4w × BS=5, 1 Redis | 351ms | ✓ |
| T7 | 4w × BS=20, 2 Redis | 623ms | ❌ |
| T7+save_status | 4w × BS=5, 2 Redis, dirty Redis | 564ms | ❌ |
| **T7+abatch_get** | **4w × BS=5, 2 Redis, clean Redis** | **430ms** | **✓** |

## Tier 8: BS=20 Passes with All Optimizations

**Hypothesis:** Tier 6 showed 4w × BS=20 → 1,450ms. With abatch_get + batch XACK + save_status + 2 Redis, can BS=20 pass 500ms?

**Answer: Yes.**

### What changed from Tier 6 to Tier 8

| Operation | Tier 6 | Tier 8 | Delta |
|-----------|--------|--------|-------|
| Notification reads | 80 individual HGETALL round-trips | 4 pipelines (20 each) | −95% round-trips |
| Delivery writes | 80 × 3-command pipelines (HSET+SET+ZADD) | 80 × 1 HSET | −67% commands |
| Stream ACKs | 80 XACK commands | 4 XACK (batch) | −95% commands |
| Stream vs API contention | 1 Redis (shared) | 2 Redis (split) | Full isolation |

Redis is single-threaded. Fewer commands in flight = shorter queue per command = lower API latency.

### Result: 4w × BS=20, 2 Redis, clean keyspace

```
post_send_duration:     avg=329ms  p(95)=433ms  ✓
get_by_id_duration:     avg=110ms  p(95)=157ms  ✓
list_by_user_duration:  avg=164ms  p(95)=226ms  ✓
http_req_failed:        0.00%       ✓
checks_succeeded:       100%        ✓
```

**Tier 6 → Tier 8 at BS=20: 1,450ms → 433ms.** Same 4 workers, same batch size, 3× latency reduction.

### Incidental finding: setup() EOF race

When k6 ran immediately after container restart, `setup()` got EOF responses (API re-establishing connection pools). The 200 seeded IDs weren't collected → `seedIds.length === 0` → all GET requests used the dummy fallback UUID → 37,076 404s → `http_req_failed = 20%`. Fix: wait 8–10s after container restart before running k6.

### Final progression

| Tier | Config | POST p95 | Pass? |
|------|--------|----------|-------|
| T4 | 1w × BS=20, 1 Redis | 361ms | ✓ |
| T6 | 4w × BS=20, 1 Redis | 1,450ms | ❌ |
| T6a | 4w × BS=5, 1 Redis | 351ms | ✓ |
| T7 | 4w × BS=20, 2 Redis | 623ms | ❌ |
| T7+ | 4w × BS=5, 2 Redis + abatch | 430ms | ✓ |
| **T8** | **4w × BS=20, 2 Redis + all opts** | **433ms** | **✓** |

Tier 8 achieves the same latency as Tier 7+ (430ms ≈ 433ms) while processing 4× more messages per batch cycle. The extra batch capacity is free headroom for traffic spikes.

## Tier 9A: Redis TTL (Keyspace Expiry)

**Change:** Added `NOTIFICATION_TTL_S` (default 7 days) to all `save()` / `asave()` pipelines.  
Notification HASHes now carry `EXPIRE` on creation. Idempotency keys have their own independent 24h TTL.

**Behavior notes:**
- `volatile-lru` eviction policy set on primary Redis; has no effect without `--maxmemory` flag (eviction never triggers unless `maxmemory` is configured)
- New notifications: `TTL = 604800` ✓
- Old notifications (before this change): `TTL = -1` (persist forever) — no retroactive TTL
- ZADD user timeline has no TTL — "phantom members" accumulate after notification HASH expires
- `aget()`, `abatch_get()`, `list_for_user()` all have `if d` guards that filter expired HASHes from results

**Production checklist:**
1. Set `--maxmemory` + `maxmemory-policy volatile-lru` in Redis config
2. Monitor `redis_keyspace_hits` vs `redis_keyspace_misses` — eviction rate should be near-zero under normal load
3. Consider ZADD cleanup job to prune phantom members from user timelines

---

## Tier 9B: Fan-out (Batch Broadcast)

**Change:** Added `POST /fanout` endpoint — broadcasts one message to N users in 3 Redis round-trips regardless of N.

**Write amplification:** Each user requires 6 Redis commands (idempotency GET + HSET + EXPIRE + SET + ZADD + XADD). This is unavoidable — every user needs its own state. What CAN be optimized is RTT count.

**Optimization:** Replaced sequential `aget_by_key()` × N loop (N round-trips for dedup) with `aget_existing_keys()` — pipelines N GETs in one round-trip.

**3-RTT design (constant regardless of N):**
```
RTT 1: pipeline GET × N         → dedup check (which users already got this message?)
RTT 2: pipeline HSET+EXPIRE+SET+ZADD × M  → save M new notifications (M ≤ N after dedup)
RTT 3: pipeline XADD × M       → enqueue M to delivery stream
```

**Benchmark:**

| N | avg | per_user |
|---|-----|---------|
| 1 | 10ms | 10ms |
| 10 | 3.6ms | 0.36ms |
| 100 | 21ms | 0.21ms |
| 1,000 | 176ms | 0.18ms |
| 5,000 | 898ms | 0.18ms |

Per-user cost stabilizes at ~0.18ms for large N, confirming pipeline efficiency. N=5000 at ~900ms reflects data transfer cost (20,000 commands in 3 batches), not RTT overhead.

**ZADD phantom member issue:** notification HASH has TTL=7d, but user ZSET has no TTL → phantom members accumulate. Mitigated by `if d` guard in `list_for_user`; production fix requires periodic ZADD cleanup.

---

## Tier 9C: Priority Queue (Dual Stream)

**Change:** Added `notifications:critical` stream. `POST /send` and `POST /fanout` accept `priority: "critical" | "normal"`. Workers poll critical stream first (non-blocking), fall back to normal stream (blocking).

**Key design:**
```
Producer: route to STREAM_KEY_CRITICAL if priority == "critical" else STREAM_KEY
Consumer: 
  1. xreadgroup(STREAM_KEY_CRITICAL, block=None)  → non-blocking check
  2. if empty: xreadgroup(STREAM_KEY, block=BLOCK_MS)  → wait for normal
```

**Critical XACK bug:** must `xack(stream_key, ...)` on the stream the message was READ FROM — not always `STREAM_KEY`. Messages read from `STREAM_KEY_CRITICAL` must be ACKed there; otherwise they accumulate in the PEL forever.

**Routing verification:**
```
Send 3 normal + 2 critical:
  notifications:delivery  +3 ✓
  notifications:critical  +2 ✓
```

**Priority effect (low load):** both streams drain instantly (idle workers). Priority gap is measurable under sustained load where normal stream has persistent backlog.

**Measured delivery times (80 normal + 5 critical):**
- Critical avg: 0.33s
- Normal p50: 0.66s
- Speedup: ~2×

**Production guidance:**
- Monitor `XLEN notifications:critical` — alert if depth > 100
- Use ≤ 3 priority levels (critical/high/normal) — more adds operational complexity
- Both streams share one consumer group (`delivery-workers`); no dedicated critical worker needed

---

## Tier 9D: Horizontal API Scaling Revisit

**Question:** With async routes + Redis backend, does adding uvicorn workers (4 vs 1) improve throughput?

**Answer: No measurable improvement.**

**Benchmark results:**

| Concurrency | 1 Worker RPS | 4 Workers RPS | Δ |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|---|
| 50 | 1,189 | 1,380 | +16% (noise) |
| 100 | 1,435 | 1,354 | −6% (noise) |
| 200 | 1,481 | 1,450 | −2% (noise) |
| 300 | 1,538 | 1,625 | +6% (noise) |

**Why:** FastAPI + aioredis is I/O-bound async. A single event loop suspends at every `await`, allowing hundreds of concurrent coroutines to progress simultaneously. The GIL is released during Redis network I/O. Adding workers just creates more event loops competing for the same Redis — no throughput gain, slightly more connection overhead.

**When workers DO help:**
- CPU-intensive work (encryption, heavy JSON processing at 10K+ RPS)
- Sync blocking code in the request path (incompatible with asyncio)
- Need fault isolation between instances

**True bottleneck at 1,000–1,500 RPS:**
1. Redis command throughput (6+ commands per POST /send)
2. Python thread pool (for `deliver()` which is sync)
3. Connection pool contention under extreme concurrency

**Production guidance:**
- For I/O-bound async workloads, scale the bottleneck (Redis), not the API
- Scale API instances for HA/fault tolerance, not throughput
- To break 5,000 RPS: Redis cluster + pipeline optimization are the levers

**podman-compose scaling limitation:** `--scale notification-api=N` fails when `ports: "8000:8000"` is set (port conflict). For production, use Kubernetes Deployment with replicas and a Service instead of docker-compose scale.

---

## Tier 10A: PEL Recovery（Dead Consumer Message Reclaim）

**Problem:** Redis Consumer Groups provide at-least-once, not exactly-once delivery. When a worker crashes after XREADGROUP but before XACK, the claimed messages stay in the Pending Entry List (PEL) forever — `XREADGROUP ... >` only delivers NEW messages, not existing PEL entries.

**First evidence:** On system startup after any restart, the workers immediately found and recovered 80 messages from previous test runs that had never been ACKed.

**Fix:** `_recover_pending()` using `XAUTOCLAIM` (Redis 6.2+):
```python
next_id, claimed, deleted = await r.xautoclaim(
    stream, GROUP_NAME, CONSUMER_NAME,
    min_idle_time=PEL_CLAIM_TIMEOUT_MS,   # 60s >> max delivery time (15s)
    start_id="0-0",
    count=BATCH_SIZE,
)
```
Iterates both streams with cursor pagination until `next_id == "0-0"`. Each page of reclaimed messages runs through the same `_process_batch()` path — delivery and ACK are identical to normal flow.

**Demo verified:**
1. Zombie consumer claimed 1 message, never ACKed
2. PEL showed: `{message_id: ..., consumer: zombie-DEAD, idle: 37229ms}`
3. XAUTOCLAIM with `min_idle_time=5000` reclaimed it
4. PEL after: 0 zombie messages ✓

**Jitter:** each worker's PEL check is staggered by `random.uniform(0, PEL_CHECK_INTERVAL_S)` to avoid all 4 workers sweeping simultaneously. Even if two workers race, XAUTOCLAIM is atomic — only one wins the claim.

**Timeout design rule:** `PEL_CLAIM_TIMEOUT_MS > ATTEMPT_TIMEOUT_S × MAX_RETRIES = 15s`. Default: 60s (4× safety margin). Too short = false positive (re-deliver a message still in flight). Too long = slow recovery from actual crashes.

**At-least-once implication:** if a worker completes `deliver()` then crashes before `XACK`, recovery will re-deliver. For notification systems, duplicate is acceptable. Exactly-once requires idempotent channel receivers or 2-phase commit.

**New metric:** `pel_recovered_total{stream}` — Grafana alert: `rate(pel_recovered_total[5m]) > 100` signals unstable workers.

## Tier 10D: Kafka Migration Analysis

**When to migrate:** Redis Streams is not the bottleneck at current scale. Triggers for Kafka:

| Trigger | Threshold |
|---------|-----------|
| Sustained throughput | > 100K msg/s |
| Retention requirement | > 7 days |
| Multiple independent consumers | > 3 consumer groups |
| Cross-DC replication | Required |
| Exactly-once semantics | Business critical |

**Key differences:**

| Feature | Redis Streams | Kafka |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| Dead consumer recovery | XAUTOCLAIM (manual, Tier 10A) | Automatic offset replay on restart |
| Consumer parallelism | Unlimited consumers, complex PEL | Bounded by partition count |
| Retention | Memory-limited (MAXLEN trim) | Disk-based, near-unlimited |
| Replay | Limited (XRANGE) | Full (offset reset) |
| Exactly-once | Needs 2PC or idempotent receiver | Kafka Transactions (adds ~2ms) |
| Ops complexity | Low | High (broker cluster, rebalancing) |

**Topic design if migrated:**
```
notifications.normal   — 16 partitions, 7-day retention, partition key=user_id
notifications.critical —  8 partitions, 7-day retention
notifications.dlq      —  4 partitions, 30-day retention
```

`user_id` as partition key → same user's notifications are ordered + concentrated on one consumer → fewer cross-consumer Redis conflicts. Hotspot risk mitigated via custom partitioner for high-volume users.

**Zero-downtime migration path:** dual-write (Redis Streams + Kafka shadow), validate shadow consumer, cut over, drain Redis PEL, remove Redis Streams writes.

**Core insight:** Redis Streams PEL ≈ Kafka uncommitted offset. Both face the "claim but crash" problem; solutions differ (XAUTOCLAIM vs offset reset). Redis requires self-implementing recovery (Tier 10A); Kafka handles it natively but at the cost of partition-bounded parallelism and operational complexity.
